Hello Guys... Welcome to new project. In this project, we'll be creating a program that allows us to send e-mails using Python.

Follow the steps below:

Step 1: Go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and turn on "Allow Less Secure Apps". Choose the account you want for Python and then Turn On
Step 2: Open Command Prompt (Windows Key + R and type 'cmd' and press Enter.
Step 3: Type the following command: 'python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n localhost:1025'. Don't close the cmd window. Minimize it.
Step 4: Open Pycharm and create a new project. Give it a name.
Step 5: Create a Python file and name it as 'app'
Step 6: Copy the code from GitHub and paste it on your 'app.py' file.
Step 7: Run the program and enter your email address, password and receiver email address. Then, type the message you want to send. And then, hit Enter.

Wait untill you get the message 'Message sent successfully' (Make sure you have connected your PC to internet)

To check the program,
Step 1: Open Gmail and choose your account.
Step 2: Go to 'Sent' page and check the sent messages. You'll find the message that you sent from Python program.

That's it

Now you've created a program that sends email
